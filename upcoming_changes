I am a dedicated and passionate Computational Chemist currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the University of California, Merced, under the guidance of Dr. Christine Isborn. My research is deeply rooted in understanding molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics to explore the behaviors and properties of molecules at an intricate level. With a robust background in computational spectroscopy, protein-ligand binding free energies, resonance energy transfer processes, and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), I strive to bridge the gap between theoretical chemistry and practical applications.

My expertise spans across various advanced computational techniques such as classical and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics, ab initio molecular dynamics, Hartree-Fock (HF), Density Functional Theory (DFT), and Time-dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT). I have a profound interest in vibronic spectroscopy and have conducted extensive research on the vibronic absorption and emission spectra of Nile red in different solvents, utilizing functionals like CAM-B3LYP, M06-2X, and LC-wHPBE.

During my industrial experience as a CADD intern at Frontier Medicines, I honed my skills in drug discovery techniques, employing ligand docking, structure-based design, and free energy calculations to innovate in the field of medicinal chemistry. My contributions are well-documented through multiple peer-reviewed publications in high-impact journals, reflecting my ability to conduct high-quality research and collaborate effectively with other scientists.

I am proficient in developing computational tools using Python and C++ to analyze chemical data and derive meaningful insights. My goal is to use these computational methodologies to advance our understanding of chemical processes and contribute to the development of new materials and medicines.
