## 🌟 About Me
👋 Hi, there welcome to my GitHub! I'm a computational chemistry wizard 🧙‍♂️ obsessed with understanding molecules through data 📊! I perform quantum calculations 🤯 to see electrons dance, run molecular simulations 🔬 to watch molecules move, and build ML models 📈 to predict chemical properties. The computational pipelines I develop screens thousands of compounds 🎛️ and crunch big chemical data 📌 to discover new insights. I develop tools in Python and C++ 🛠️ to analyze all the things about molecules! My chemistry spells and algorithms transform raw data into molecular insights. Let's use the power of computation to advance medicines, materials and more! 🚀
