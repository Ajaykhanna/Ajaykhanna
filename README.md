  - Developed computational spectroscopy methods to accurately model experimental absorption and fluorescence spectra of molecules using ab initio molecular dynamics, leading to a deeper understanding of environmental effects on molecular properties.
  - Partnered on a $7.5M DOD-funded "Polariton" project, linking experimental results to quantum molecular properties.
  - Performed high throughput molecular dynamics (MD), quantum mechanical (QM) simulations, extensive Density Functional Theory functionals, and basis-sets benchmark studies on molecules in various solvents. 
  -  Developed a Python code to compute molecules' quantum mechanical vibrational frequencies in explicit solvents and interfaced it with GPU-based quantum chemistry code TeraChem, now part of the MolSpecPy python package. Added fluorescence spectra calculations feature to the code using energy gradient obtained from electronic structure codes like TeraChem and Gaussian.
