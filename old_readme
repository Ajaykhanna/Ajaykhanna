## Work Experience
- **Intern, CADD,** Frontier Medicines, South San Francisco, CA, USA (May 2023 â€“ Aug 2023)
  - Developed Python program to streamline SMILES to desolvation energy calculations using AFEP/TI techniques and SMILES to conformational sampling both in OpenMM.
  - Learned unbiased and biased ligand-based docking in MOE, later used to perform ligand-binding free energy calculations.
  - Built Protein-Ligand binding free energy and desolvation energy calculation pipelines for Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitors using hybrid QM/MM techniques.

- **Graduate Student Researcher**, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, UC Merced (Aug.2018 - Spring.2024)
  - Developed computational spectroscopy methods to accurately model experimental absorption and fluorescence spectra of molecules using ab initio molecular dynamics, leading to a deeper understanding of environmental effects on molecular properties.
  - Partnered on a $7.5M DOD-funded "Polariton" project, linking experimental results to quantum molecular properties.
  - Performed high throughput molecular dynamics (MD), quantum mechanical (QM) simulations, extensive Density Functional Theory functionals, and basis-sets benchmark studies on molecules in various solvents. 
  -  Developed a Python code to compute molecules' quantum mechanical vibrational frequencies in explicit solvents and interfaced it with GPU-based quantum chemistry code TeraChem, now part of the [MolSpecPy](https://github.com/Ajaykhanna/Spectroscopy_python_code) python package. Added fluorescence spectra calculations feature to the code using energy gradient obtained from electronic structure codes like TeraChem and Gaussian.
  - Managed local HPC clusters, including installed CUDA libraries and CUDA-based QM software. Efficiently automated large-scale molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics jobs using Slurm, bash, and Python scripts.

- **Teaching Assistant** UC Merced (Aug.2018 â€“ Dec.2022)
    - Taught introductory chemistry courses (> 95% 1st gen students) and prepared worksheet materials for 4 years.

- **Research Intern**, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (Jan.2018 â€“ July.2018)
    - Reproduced experimental absorption and fluorescence spectra of Alexa Fluor dyes in implicit solvents using fundamental spectroscopy and Gaussian calculations.

- **Research Intern**, Indian Association for the Cultivation Science (Aug.2017 â€“ Nov.2017)
    - Developed a computational molecular dynamics procedure to generate 3D DNA origami nanostructures using Cadnano and oxDNA, later used to generate unique metal clusters.   

- **Research Assistant**, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela (July 2016 â€“ July.2017)
    - Conducted quantum mechanical investigation of Zintl phases, showed 18-electron rule's ability to predict and design better Zintl ions and Zintl phases with better magnetic properties.
